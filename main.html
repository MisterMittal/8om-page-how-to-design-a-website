                <!-- Starting Block -->
                <div>
                    <p>Designing a website right from the scratch can be a frantic task. It’s simpler for people who are
                        familiar with the software and their applications but everyone isn't well versed with its codes
                        and algorithms. A website’s design and language is altogether a different terminology to
                        decipher. Designing a business website has multiple phases that need calculated execution. Also,
                        delivering them perfectly can be very tricky.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Here, we are going to briefly explain how to design a website in easy steps and new skills with
                        the help of which you can learn to develop a website:</p>

                    <div class="point-block">
                        <div class="point-txt">
                            <div>
                                <h2>Webpage design</h2>
                                <p>A neat and articulate webpage design will not only attract more users but also make
                                    them return quickly if your website is responsive and has a friendly user interface.
                                    The header and footer pages of the website are strong determinants of the overall
                                    outlook of the website. Content is the hallmark of the website through which we
                                    interact with our users, so choose it wisely. Minimalism and simplicity will never
                                    be out of fashion for a good web page design.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="point-img">
                            <img src="images/webpage-design-o.jpg" alt="webpage design" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="point-block">
                        <div class="point-txt order-1">
                            <div>
                                <h2>Follow design standards</h2>
                                <p>One can choose the template designs from various websites such as Wix, Canva,
                                    Wordpress, etc. That support as a base for website builders. The hierarchy of
                                    information and page layout makes the website more or less user-friendly as a reader
                                    can find the information conveniently. Studies have stated the web pages having a
                                    layout like ‘above the fold’ of a newspaper are more likely to be read whether on a
                                    laptop, desktop or smartphone. The design of a website should not resemble a book or
                                    poster, hence the design standards must be kept in mind. For example, think about
                                    search bars and magnifying glass that are present most commonly at the end of the
                                    header menu.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="point-img">
                            <img src="images/design-standards-o.jpg" alt="design standards" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="point-block">
                        <div class="point-txt">
                            <div>
                                <h2>User Interface Design</h2>
                                <p>This is the soul of your website that generates traffic. Understand user interface as
                                    a fundamental, responsible for the basic functioning of the website. For example,
                                    your products are listed on the website in an irregular manner, so how will the
                                    buyer unriddle where to buy the products! User interface helps the customers to
                                    navigate throughout the website without any complexity because if not, the traffic
                                    would be sent away. UI/UX is the new way of experiencing user-friendly applications
                                    and building a responsive website design.</p>

                                <p>Front end developments are those visible to the client like web design and layout.
                                    Back end work, on the contrary, is not visible to the customers such as databases
                                    and services. HTML, Java, CSS and jQuery, etc. are used by web developers
                                    recurrently to run the coding. Front end web design is about landing the features in
                                    place and navigating the reader without making changes on the website. These
                                    functionalities organize the site symmetrically and should be free of errors and
                                    bugs. The front end web development sews up the way a website will look on the
                                    internet.</p>
